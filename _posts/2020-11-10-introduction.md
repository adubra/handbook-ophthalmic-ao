### Light propagation

Rays and wavefronts to describe light propagation
Explain that mostly geometrical optics is sufficient to understand adaptive optics, although diffraction theory is necessary to explain some phenomena affecting AO.

### Optical systems
Reflection, refraction, absorption, scattering, diffraction

Pupil planes (entrance, exit others)
marginal ray, chief/principal ray

### Imaging systems

Flood illumination and scanning optical systems.

Converging wavefront.

Wavefront aberration as the departure of the wavefront from the ideal spherical or flat shape. More general definition as a difference between wavefronts.

Wavefront polynomial as an approximation

Third order or Seidel aberrations

Highlight that aberrations can and do change across fields of view

Discuss isoplanatism concept and consider alternative definitions in terms or various wavefront RMS norms (e.g. L0, L1, L2, others?)
