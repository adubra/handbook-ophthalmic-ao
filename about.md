### Foreword

Adaptive optics (AO) is a set of technologies for the dynamic manipulating optical wavefronts. Ophthalmic AO is the subset of these technologies used to modify the wavefront aberrations that are unique to each living eye. Beyond the defocus and astigmatism that can be corrected with spectacles, the wavefront aberrations introduce by the optics of the eye introduce blur that limits the transverse and axial resolution of retinal imaging devices, that is, ophthalmoscopes. This blur also prevents the optical stimulation of small retinal areas, such as those covered by individual photoreceptor cells. The spatial resolution improvement that results from the correction of the ocular aberrations enables the non-invasive study of structure and function at the cellular scale, effectively transforming ophthalmoscopes into microscopes. Ophthalmic AO can also be used to deliberately introduce aberrations to study the visual system and to allow subjects to experience the potential outcome of refractive surgery or intraocular lens replacement.

Ophthalmic AO applications have the potential to transform the study, diagnosing and management of diseases that affect the eye. For this potential to materialize, however, the technology must become accessible to non-experts. This handbook aims to facilitate this by providing a pedagogical, rigorous, and comprehensive resource for users and developers of ophthalmic AO. Particular emphasis will be placed in the introduction of essential concepts and jargon, as well as providing tips and describing best practices that allow non-experts to effectively use this technology.
