Dr. Sabesan earned his Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and his Ph.D. in Optics at the Institute of Optics and Center for Visual Science at the University of Rochester. He did a postdoctoral fellowship at the School of Optometry at University of California, Berkeley studying the retinal basis of color perception using advanced high-resolution imaging, before joining the faculty at University of Washington Department of Ophthalmology. At UW, Dr.Sabesan holds adjunct appointments in the departments of Bioengineering and of Biological Structure, and is a member of the Graduate program in Neuroscience and University of Washington Institute for Neuroengineering. The Sabesan lab’s basic vision science and translation research questions are centered around the ability of ophthalmic adaptive optics to provide in vivo cellular scale access to the visual system for physiological and psychophysical assays.
