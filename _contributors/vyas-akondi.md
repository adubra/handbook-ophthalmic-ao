Dr. Akondi obtained Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics from the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Prasanthi Nilayam, and his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. This was followed by a first postdoctoral fellowship at the School of Physics of the University College Dublin, under the supervision of Dr. Brian Vohnsen, where he developed digital wavefront sensing methods using spatial light modulators. Later, as a senior postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Susana Marcos at the Instituto de Ã“ptica (CSIC), Madrid, he worked on wavefront sensing problems in patients implanted with multifocal intraocular lenses. Further, he developed methods to simulate lenses using a head-mounted tunable lens-based device for prospective refractive surgery patients and contact lens wearers. As a senior research scientist in the Dubra lab at Stanford, he works on addressing technical barriers to the clinical translation of adaptive optics retinal imaging.
